# Mini Shell 

I started learning C language and I decided to create a mini shell to practice what I learned.


### Description

This is a mini shell that can run commands with their arguments.

For the moment, it can only run commands with their arguments, but I will add more features in the future.

### How to use

> In progress...

### Run commands

To run a command, you just need to type the command name and its arguments.

```bash

$ ls -l
```

### Features to add

- [ ] Run commands in background
- [ ] Run commands with pipes
- [ ] Run commands with redirections
- [ ] Build my own commands
- [ ] Add a history
- [ ] Add a completion
